# Semantic Analysis
*Documentation for the semantic analysis section of my project*

### How to Run
1. Enter the name of the file with code to read on line 13 of `lexer.py`
2. Run `analyser.py`
3. At the end, it will print the syntax table and the errors

### Errors
 There is one output file: `sem_errors.txt` to store any semantic errors that occur within the project. Each semantic error phrase should specify the line at which the error occurs.
